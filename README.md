## Landing Page Behavior
- **Header (Navigation):**
 Built dynamically using JavaScript(Didn't build it using HTML)
    - Note: There are 4 Methods to build it, they all work (Just Uncomment the one you wanna try and comment the others )
    1. *First Method*:
        -  A very boring method that depends on creating each li and each a solely then append < a> to the < li> element - No loops used
    2. *Second Method*:
        - Used an array to store the navigation items then looped over them
    3. *Third Method*: 
        - Used a for loop to create 4 navigation items dynamically but this one will only create items that has the same name for all items for example (Section1, Section2, Section3 ...etc)
    4. *Fourth Method*: 
        - Used a forEach loop that loops through the data-* for each section ( I really like this one, BTW: It's not mine, it was my student advocate's but I didn't find his repo )

 - **Section Active State** : Built using[ getBoundingClientRect()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_getboundingclientrect.asp) Method 
        
 - **Scroll to Anchor**: Using the plane way of adding the id of a section to the href of an anchor 

## Background gradient
I generated it using [CSS gradient](https://cssgradient.io/)
